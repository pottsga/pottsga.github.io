## Summary

A few useful commands that I don't want to forget.

## bash/zsh

- `du`
  - `du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -n 10` recursively finds the largest files/directories in human readable format
- `find`
  - `find . -type f -mtime +30 -delete` delete all files in the current directory that are older than 30 days
  - `find [directory_location] -name "[search_string]" [-type [f,d]] [-exec something]` recursively find a file that matches a search_string
    - Ex: `find ~ -name "*.txt" -type f` finds all *.txt files (excludes directories)
    - Ex: `find ~ -name "*.txt" -type f -exec echo {} \;` echo's all *.txt files
- `grep`
  - `grep -r "search_string" .` recursively looks in the current directory for a search string
- `ls`
  - `ls -Slh` sort by size in long format, human readable

## Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1

If you are receiving the following error: `Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 keyxterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:11.0`, follow the following diagnostic steps:
  1. Is your X11 Windows server running? (xQuarts)? If not, start it.
    - You can tell something is wrong if you issue an `xauth list` on your local machine and nothing works.
  2. Issue the following command: `xhost +local:` before `ssh`-ing to the server.
