## Summary

A few useful commands that I don't want to forget.

## bash/zsh

- `grep -r "search_string" .` recursively looks in the current directory for a search string
- `du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -n 10` recursively finds the largest files/directories in human readable format
- `find [directory_location] -name "[search_string]" [-type [f,d]] [-exec something]` recursively find a file that matches a search_string
  - Ex: `find ~ -name "*.txt" -type f` finds all *.txt files (excludes directories)
  - Ex: `find ~ -name "*.txt" -type f -exec echo {} \;` echo's all *.txt files
